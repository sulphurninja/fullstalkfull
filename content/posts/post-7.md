Are you in need of striking and modern landing pages without the hefty monthly platform fees that some builders demand? If so, consider exploring the world of Tailwind CSS-based platforms, even if you're not a coding expert like me.

In this blog post, I'll shed light on why non-technical individuals, including marketers, should seriously consider Tailwind CSS as a practical alternative to well-established landing page builders. As someone who isn't deeply immersed in the technical aspects of coding, I've successfully developed numerous landing pages and side projects with Tailwind CSS, and I can attest that it's not as complex as it may appear.

## Introducing Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed for crafting modern websites by styling HTML files.

> CSS, in simple terms, is the language we use to give a web page its style.

Tailwind CSS provides an extensive collection of ready-to-use classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements, essentially offering a library of pre-designed styles at your fingertips!

Before delving into technical comparisons with other frameworks like Bootstrap, let me share some exciting statistics about Tailwind CSS from Tailwind Connect 2023 held on July 19, 2023:

- Tailwind CSS framework enjoys over 25 million installations per month.
- It has been installed a staggering 300 million times to date.
- Tailwind CSS has earned the distinction of being the most downloaded CSS framework on npm.

## How Tailwind CSS Empowers No-Coders

Tailwind CSS might not be a direct landing page builder, but it empowers individuals to take control of their code, specifically HTML files, which can be hosted independently at their convenience. This autonomy reduces dependency on landing page platforms with recurring fees. Let me walk you through the step-by-step process.

**Building a landing page with a subscription-based platform:**

1. Sign-up
2. Construct your landing page using the drag-and-drop editor
3. Pay a minimum of $18/month for launching and maintaining your landing page

**Building a landing page with a Tailwind CSS landing page builder:**

1. Sign-up (let's use Shuffle as an example)
2. Develop your landing page using the drag-and-drop editor
3. Pay $24/month for building and exporting your code
4. Create a new GitHub account and repository (free)
5. Upload (push, in geek terms) your exported file from Shuffle
6. Create a Vercel account and import your GitHub repo (free)
7. Publish (deploy, in other words) your code and connect the domain (free)
8. Host your landing page on Vercel (free)

By creating a new GitHub account and repository, you can host your code independently at no cost. Utilizing Vercel, you can effortlessly deploy your landing page and connect your domain without incurring additional expenses. This approach translates into significant cost savings, sparing you from recurring fees that could surpass $190/year for a single website.

It's essential to note that Tailwind CSS, along with builders like Shuffle, may not be the optimal choice for every landing page scenario. Tailwind CSS serves as a cost-effective solution, offering complete control over design and hosting for straightforward, static landing pages with fewer than 20 pages that don't require frequent updates.

However, for more complex landing pages involving CMS integration, paywalls, and additional features like built-in SEO controls, subscription-based platforms may be a suitable choice. The decision ultimately boils down to striking a balance between the convenience and support offered by subscription-based platforms and the long-term cost efficiency and flexibility offered by Tailwind CSS.

Let's take a closer look at two options‚ÄîWebflow and Shuffle‚Äîfor building landing pages to understand the different practices involved:

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Webflow

**Webflow:**

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Hassle-free hosting
- Built-in CDN
- Built-in CMS option (starting from $29/mo)
- Native e-commerce integration (starting from $29/mo)
- Robust security measures
- User-friendly SEO controls

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:**
- Complex pricing structure
- Costs can escalate with multiple websites
- Basic HTML knowledge is still required for maximizing the drag-and-drop editor
- Webflow templates offer attractive designs but limited component variety

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Shuffle

**Shuffle:**

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Pre-built dashboard and landing page UI templates
- User-friendly page builder
- No export limitations
- Clear documentation
- Includes 4,000+ UI components in the package
- Allows importing code from other UI libraries

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:**
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Tailwind CSS is required for design and code adjustments
- Imported designs can't be edited using the Shuffle visual editor; code editing is necessary
- Requires learning how to publish your code

The choice between these two approaches depends on your project's specific needs and objectives. Tailwind CSS offers a compelling option for no-coders seeking autonomy, cost savings, and a deeper understanding of their website's inner workings. Assess your project requirements carefully to determine the most efficient and cost-effective path to success for your landing page endeavors.

However, if you desire fancy animations, built-in blogging, or e-commerce features, sticking with traditional landing page builders you're familiar with might be a better choice.

With this option, you'll only need to customize colors, fonts, copy, and images to create a completely unique landing page design and code. Voil√†, your brand-new landing page is ready to shine! üéâ

# Why AWS?

In the mid-2000s, companies primarily relied on private servers for their computing needs. However, the emergence of faster internet speeds has shifted the paradigm towards cloud technologies. Businesses, regardless of their size, are now migrating to the cloud to improve performance and focus on their core competencies.

Take Netflix, for instance. In 2008, they faced a critical database issue that halted operations for three days. The root cause was scalability, prompting them to seek a highly reliable, horizontally scalable solution. AWS came to the rescue, and since then, their growth has been remarkable.

Gartner predicts that by 2020, having a "No-Cloud" policy will be as uncommon as a "No-Internet" policy today.

As virtually every company embraces cloud services in some capacity, AWS, as a major player in the industry, becomes essential knowledge.

## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, offering cost-effective cloud computing services. It caters to a diverse customer base, from small-scale startups like Pinterest to established enterprises like D-Link.

## Understanding Cloud Computing

Cloud computing involves using remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and process data, eliminating the need for local servers or personal computers. There are three primary cloud computing categories:

- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Companies can use software without the need for purchase, reducing costs and deployment time.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Developers can build applications and collaborate without infrastructure concerns.
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Companies can rent servers, storage, and more from a cloud provider.

AWS predominantly falls under the IaaS category.

## Why AWS Matters

Industry experts project significant growth in cloud computing:

- Forbes predicts a 19.4% CAGR in worldwide spending on public cloud services, reaching over $141 billion by 2019.
- Gartner anticipates that by 2019, over 30% of the largest vendors' new software investments will be cloud-only.
- The IaaS market has been growing over 40% in revenue annually since 2011 and is expected to continue growing more than 25% per year through 2019 (Gartner).

## AWS Domains

## AWS Certification

AWS certifications are highly regarded in the IT industry. The AWS Solution Architect certification is particularly in demand. To become an AWS Solution Architect, extensive knowledge and hands-on experience with AWS services are essential.

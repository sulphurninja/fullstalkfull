In the evolving world of blockchain and Web3 technologies, there's a profound challenge that can't be ignored â€“ user interfaces. This challenge comes in two distinct flavors: the "Crypto-Native" founders and the "Pre-Disastered" builders.

## The Crypto-Natives

Crypto-natives have immersed themselves in Web3 for years, forming an echo chamber of tech jargon that feels alien to most. They possess an undeniable sense of empowerment, knowing they are crafting the future. They believe in concepts that are both revolutionary and world-changing, much like the pioneers of early Web 2.0.

For these Web3 innovators, the idea of borrowing from Web 2.0 practices seems counterintuitive. Breaking away from traditional standards and embracing creativity is ingrained in Web3 DNA. After all, if you're reinventing monumental aspects like trust, digital identity, and finance, why stick to old norms when it comes to user experience and software development?

However, history has shown us that even when transitioning from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, there were valuable lessons to be learned. Understanding your users' needs, iterating designs based on their feedback, and prioritizing user-centered design principles turned out to be prerequisites for software success. Neglecting user experience often led to the downfall of otherwise promising projects.

## Statistics speak volumes:
- The ROI on UX investments is 9,900%.
- Improving customer experience can raise KPIs by over 80%.
- A good user interface can increase websites' conversion rates by up to 200%.
- 90% of users will leave a site solely due to bad design.
- 70% of online businesses fail because of bad UX.
  
When discussing these principles with crypto-native founders, they may nod in agreement, yet they remain steadfast in their belief that they don't require assistance, at least not at this juncture.

## The Pre-Disastered

On the other side are the Pre-Disastered individuals. These Web3 founders possess Web 2.0 experience and are well-versed in launching products with real-world users. They've encountered agile methodologies, user-centered design processes, and the importance of usability studies.

Some among them are seasoned UX and product professionals with extensive resumes. Curiously, many of them choose to operate quietly in the background, aligning with the culture of anonymity prevalent in the Web3 elite.

**What's conspicuously absent are the Web 2.0 Grumps**. Skilled UX and product designers aren't flocking to Web3, as they're in demand elsewhere, where their expertise is highly valued.

The outcome of this scenario? Terrible user experiences and baffling products created by teams oblivious to fundamental best practices.

## Closing Thoughts

In the realm of Web3, there's much promise and potential, but also a glaring gap in user experience and product design. The bridge between the old and the new must be built, but it may take time.

For those considering Web3, it's essential to:

- Explore the true potential of Web3 beyond the hype.
- Understand that the crypto-native community may not readily embrace traditional practices.
- Be patient and prepared to educate and collaborate.
- Distinguish between those open to learning and those resistant to change.

The journey to improving Web3's user interfaces and experiences is a complex one, but it's a path worth treading. As the divide narrows and wisdom from both eras converges, we can hope for a brighter future where user-centered design principles reign supreme.

Note: The Web3 landscape is constantly evolving, and the challenges discussed here may evolve as well. Adapting and learning are key to success in this dynamic environment.
